# SQL-Procedure-and-Transaction

Stored Procedure or SP or PROCEDURE is a group of Transact-SQL that forms a series of logic or procedures that are stored in the database as objects.

	The advantages of using Stored Procedures are:
		1. Reduces network traffic and slightly helps performance.
		2. More secure than applications that have to use lots of SQL queries to do one activity.
		3. Code that can be used repeatedly.
		4. Easier to maintain.
